Five topics related to computing that interest me:
Containers - I find them really interesting, a useful concept, but I haven't used them

MS IIS interests me, and I might implement it as a CS240B project
DDNS is something I'd like to use at home, so that I could leave my computer on, but still access it from school


Five topics that I feel are difficult right now:
Containers - they're also difficult for me, without more exposure and repeated use
Concepts and theory behind pointers in C, specifically the meaning of double asterisks, a single, or none at all (and when to use)
